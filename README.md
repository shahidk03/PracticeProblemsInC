# PracticeProblemsInC

This is A repository which contains code for programming problems which I practiced while learning C again after a long time.
If you find this repository feel free to try some problem on your own or 
leave me suggestions on how to improve my coding and C programming skills by reviewing some of my solved problems.

CHEERS!!
